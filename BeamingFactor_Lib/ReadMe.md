# This library contains beaming factors computed with three theory spectra library: [PHOENIX](https://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=15), [ATLAS9](https://wwwuser.oats.inaf.it/fiorella.castelli/grids.html), and [TMAP](http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~rauch/TMAF/flux_H+He.html).  
# File Description
Each file are archived in csv file (comma seperated ascii file).  
Files are named as *_{Filter_Name}.csv  
Filter_Name are name of filters as follows:  
>    u_SDSS,g_SDSS,r_SDSS,i_SDSS,z_SDSS are *u,g,r,i,z* from SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey);
> 
>    NUVC,uC,gC,rC,iC,zC,yC are NUV,*u,g,r,i,z,y* from CSST
>
>    *U,B,V,R,I* are Johnson filter system
>
>    *G,Gbp,Grp* are *Gaia* filter system.
> 
> TESS for TESS satellite
>
> kepler for *Kepler* satellite
